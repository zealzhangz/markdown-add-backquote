# Markdown Add Backquote README

I am a markdown deep user.When writing markdown files, it is very troublesome thing to add backquote manually.There are two scenarios: one is the two backquote of a single line of code;The other is  the block of code contained six backquote.So we used half a day to develop this simple plugin.

## Features
The selected content will be added to the line backquote.If you do not select text, plugin will add code block backquote.

Use shortcut keys to add backquotes in Markdown:

- Mac: `cmd+d`
- Windows: `ctrl+d`
